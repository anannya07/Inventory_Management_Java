This project demonstrates practical application of fundamental Core Java concepts through an inventory management solution. At its foundation, the implementation leverages Java's object-oriented programming paradigm with a well-structured class hierarchy. The Product class showcases proper encapsulation with private fields and public getters/setters, while implementing Serializable for persistent storage.
Exception handling is implemented through a custom InventoryException class, demonstrating how to create domain-specific exceptions that provide meaningful error messages rather than relying solely on generic Java exceptions. This approach enhances code readability and maintenance.
Java's Collections Framework is utilized extensively - HashMap provides O(1) lookup performance for product retrieval by ID, while ArrayList offers flexible collection management for search results and reporting. The code demonstrates advanced collection operations through Comparator implementations for sorting products by various criteria.
File I/O operations employ ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream for serialization, allowing the application to maintain data persistence between sessions without requiring a database. This showcases Java's built-in capabilities for data storage.
The implementation uses Java's modern Date/Time API (LocalDate) to manage expiration dates, demonstrating date comparisons and calculations for determining expired products. DateTimeFormatter provides flexible date formatting for user display.
Input validation throughout the user interface prevents runtime errors by catching and handling exceptions, employing loops to ensure valid input is received before proceeding with operations. This defensive programming approach creates a robust application.
The console interface demonstrates scanner usage for user input while implementing a menu-driven workflow. Helper methods abstract input complexity, enhancing code organization and readability.
The application's structure follows good software engineering principles with separation of concerns - the InventoryManager handles business logic and data operations, while the InventoryApp class manages user interaction, creating a maintainable, extendable codebase that effectively demonstrates core Java principles in a practical, real-world context.
